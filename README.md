ðŸ§® Simple Arithmetic Expression Compiler
This project is a lightweight and educational compiler that can parse and evaluate basic arithmetic expressions. Itâ€™s designed to take simple mathematical expressions as input, build an internal representation (like a parse tree), and compute the result â€” all in one streamlined process.

ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Parses and evaluates expressions with +, -, *, and / operators

âœ… Supports parentheses for proper operator precedence

âœ… Handles multi-digit numbers and whitespace gracefully

âœ… Interactive or file-based input modes

âœ… Clear error handling for invalid expressions

ðŸ§  How It Works
The compiler follows a classic multi-phase approach:

Lexical Analysis (Tokenizer)
Breaks the expression into meaningful tokens like numbers, operators, and parentheses.

Parsing
Uses recursive descent or similar techniques to turn tokens into an abstract syntax tree (AST) based on arithmetic grammar.

Evaluation
Traverses the AST and computes the result, obeying the correct order of operations.
